This is a simple pong implementation.  
AI, State Integration and timing needs love.  
But this may be done later with subpixel rendering.  

AI-notes:  
Human rection time (RT) is about 200-300 ms max.  
Since this AI doesn't interpolate I cheated.  
RT could be ranged rand, like visibility could.  
But since this is no rocket science it's good for now.
